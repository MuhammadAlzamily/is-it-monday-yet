# Is It Monday Yet ?

It's such a crucial question to be answered as we all know, Monday isn't a very welcome / easy day so i decided to step in and create this package to hopefully help someone out to find out if it's Monday yet

# Installation

`npm install is-it-monday-yet`

# Usage

```
const mon = require('is-it-monday-yet');
const info = mon.Monday_Or_Not(); // will return either true or false
```
